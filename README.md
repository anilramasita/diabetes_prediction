# diabetes_prediction

Main aim of the project is to predict whether the patient having diabetes or not using logistic regression model

1. I have used some features for independent variable and dependent variable is set at last column in the given diabetes.csv dataset named outcome.
2. I have checked if any missing values are present in my data and replaced them as zero, to get more accuracy.
3. Spiltted the data and trained using logistic regression model.


 Note: You can get accuracy by perfoming regualarization techniques(L1&L2);
